            My time is currently being taken up by my Full Time job at Jacobs. But I do wanna make sure I'm putting in extra time to keep up on new tools and work on some of my own projects to stay sharp.
        </p>
        <p>If you would like to keep up with all of the other work I'm doing outside of my work at Jacob's, please check out my GitHub Repository.</p>
